# GLOBAL-TERRORISM-DASHBOARD
This project presents a dynamic Excel dashboard built using data from the Global Terrorism Database (GTD), aimed at visualizing and understanding the global patterns and trends of terrorist activities. 
In today’s increasingly complex global landscape, the threat of terrorism continues to pose significant challenges to nations, communities, and individuals. Understanding terrorism trends, patterns, and impacts is critical not only for national security agencies but also for policymakers, researchers, and civil society organizations working towards global peace. However, terrorism data, especially in raw and unstructured formats, is often difficult to interpret and utilize effectively. This project, titled “Global Terrorism Dashboard,” was conceptualized and executed with the aim of transforming raw terrorism data into an insightful, interactive, and visually engaging Excel-based dashboard. Built using the Global Terrorism Database (GTD)—an open-source, comprehensive dataset maintained by the National Consortium for the Study of Terrorism and Responses to Terrorism (START) at the University of Maryland—this project seeks to enable users to derive meaningful conclusions from historical terrorism incidents across the globe. The dataset contains thousands of terrorism event records, detailing dates, locations, attack types, casualties, target types, weapons used, and more, making it one of the richest resources for academic and policy-related analysis. The key problem this project addresses is the overwhelming complexity of raw data formats that prevent effective interpretation by non-technical users. By transforming the dataset into a dashboard format, we make it accessible, interpretable, and actionable. The primary objectives of the project were to extract, clean, and process the relevant portions of the GTD, select the most meaningful columns, and build a dynamic visualization platform in Microsoft Excel, which is user-friendly and widely used in academia, business, and government sectors. The core goals included presenting year-wise and region-wise terrorism data, mapping the types of attacks, showcasing most affected countries, analyzing casualties, and calculating the success or failure rates of attacks through visual elements like pivot tables, pivot charts, slicers, and KPIs (Key Performance Indicators). The dataset used for the project was specifically the GTD file for January to June 2021, and from this, around 11 essential columns were chosen, including Year, Month, Country, Region, Attack Type, Weapon Type, Target Type, Number Killed, Number Wounded, and Success of Attack. Initial steps involved cleaning the data by filtering out blank, null, or unknown values, converting date fields into a usable format, and combining numeric fields to calculate additional insights such as total casualties. Following this, several pivot tables were created to summarize the data by key dimensions such as year-wise attacks, region-wise trends, attack type frequency, country-level impacts, and weapon usage. The dashboard’s design emphasized interactivity, allowing users to dynamically filter data through slicers connected to pivot charts. These slicers enabled filtering by year, country, region, weapon type, attack type, and success status. Each visual element in the dashboard was laid out with a clear and consistent design aesthetic using modern fonts, soft color palettes, and smart alignment to maintain professional appeal. KPIs showing total number of incidents, casualties, and success rates were prominently placed at the top of the dashboard to give a quick snapshot. Visual elements such as line charts for trends over time, pie charts for proportional breakdowns, and bar charts for top countries provided deeper insights. A major focus of the project was also on design optimization—ensuring that all charts and slicers were properly aligned, labeled, and responsive to user interaction. Report connections were used to ensure all slicers controlled all charts simultaneously, enhancing the user experience. Furthermore, the dashboard background was customized with light colors and rounded borders to improve readability and user engagement. The significance of this dashboard lies in its ability to convert large-scale data into a format that supports data-driven decisions and discussions. It can be used by students to enhance academic research, by professors for lectures, by NGOs to raise awareness, and by governments for planning and policy-making. For students and aspiring data analysts, the project demonstrates a deep understanding of Excel, including functions like pivot tables, slicers, helper columns, chart formatting, and layout planning. It showcases skills in data cleaning, transformation, dashboard design, and storytelling through data. The dashboard can be further customized in the future to include additional years of data, integration with Power BI, or export to other visualization platforms. This project also serves as a real-world demonstration of how open-source data can be harnessed to create impactful insights. The project reflects not just technical skills, but also critical thinking, creativity, and attention to detail. It aligns with real-world applications such as public safety, international relations, and journalism. Moreover, working on this project enhances a learner’s understanding of global conflict trends and highlights the human cost of terrorism in a visually interpretable way. Through the GTD dashboard, the complexity of terrorism data is simplified, and an intuitive interface is created for exploring multiple angles of analysis. By providing this rich, visual storytelling tool, the project bridges the gap between raw data and actionable insight. In conclusion, the Global Terrorism Dashboard project has met its objectives of translating large-scale terrorism event data into an elegant, easy-to-use dashboard that can aid research, analysis, and policy. It stands as a testament to the power of Excel as a tool for real-world data visualization and analysis and is a valuable portfolio piece for any student or professional interested in data science, public policy, international security, or analytics. The project not only helps understand what has happened but can potentially inform strategies to prevent future incidents. This dashboard is not the end—it’s a launchpad for deeper inquiry, continuous learning, and proactive engagement with global issues.
